### Todo
- [ ] Find alternate solution to typewriter function with tkinter
- [ ] Find alternate solution to text colorization with tkinter
- [ ] Allow the player to change the text size and window? Scaling?
- [ ] Create a separate class to handle the GUI while game class handles game logic? Or at least create a separate class to handle displaying messages in the window so that other classes can access it.
- [ ] See [text-based-adventure/TODO.md](https://github.com/frankiebry/text-based-adventure/blob/main/TODO.md) for tasks not related to the tkinter adaption.

### Ideas for changes/improvements
- [ ] Find a better theme than darkly? Or more stlying options to fit the dungeon crawler / rpg theme

### Bugs/Issues
- [ ]

### Cleaner Code
- [ ] Currently passing the game class into the monster class so the monster class can display messages. Change this so that messages are handled in game (the way you did with the inventory class) or create a new separate class for messages.
